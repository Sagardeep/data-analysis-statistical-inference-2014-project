Research Question
-----------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
In one sentence, what is your research question?

#### Evaluation
Do you understand the research question? How can the question be made clearer? Is it clear how data can be used to answer this research question as its phrased?

### Answer

Data - Citation
---------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Include a citation for your data, and if your data set is online, provide a link to the source.

#### Evaluation
Is there a citation for the data? If there is a link provided, does it bring you to the data?

### Answer

Data - Collection
-----------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Describe how the data were collected.

#### Evaluation
Is the data collection explained clearly?

### Answer

Data - Cases (observational/experimental units)
-----------------------------------------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
What are the cases? (Remember: case = units of observation or units of experiment)

#### Evaluation
Are the cases (the units of observation or experimental units) explained clearly?

### Answer

Data - Variables
----------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
What are the two variables you will be studying? State the type of each variable.

#### Evaluation
Are the variable types identified accurately?

### Answer

Data - Type of study
--------------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
What is the type of study? Is it an observational study or an experiment?
Explain how you've arrived at your conclusion using information on the sampling and/or experimental design.

#### Evaluation
Is the type of study identified correctly? Is the supporting information on the sampling and/or experimental design of the study satisfactory for making the decision on the type of study?

### Answer

Data - Scope of inference - generalizability
--------------------------------------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Identify the population of interest, and whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population. Explain why or why not.
Also discuss any potential sources of bias that might prevent generalizability.

#### Evaluation
Did the writer correctly identify the population of interest? Did the writer correctly decide whether the findings from this analysis can be generalized to that population, or, if not, a subsection of that population? Is their explanation satisfactory to make this decision? Are potential sources of bias discussed, and if so, is the discussion satisfactory?

### Answer

Data - Scope of inference - causality
-------------------------------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Can these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest? Explain why or why not.

#### Evaluation
Did the writer identify correctly whether these data be used to establish causal links between the variables of interest. Is the explanation satisfactory?

### Answer

Exploratory Data Analysis
-------------------------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Perform a brief exploratory data analysis - just one or two relevant descriptive statistics and visualizations of the data. Also address what the exploratory data analysis suggests about your research question.
You can include summary statistics in your write up in the space provided below by copying and pasting the R output, however you must upload your plot(s) as a separate PDF or image file. Make sure to provide a discussion/interpretation of any summary statistic or plot you include.
Note: This is not required to be an exhaustive exploratory data analysis (you can save that for the second phase), instead it's just intended to ensure that you have successfully imported your data set into R such that you can produce plots and numerical summaries.

#### Evaluation
Have relevant summary statistics been produced and discussed?
Is there a visualization of the data, and has it been interpreted properly?

### Answer

Data Set
--------

### Question and Evaluation

#### Question
Attach a page of your data set that includes all of the relevant columns. You do not need to include all of the data; one page is sufficient.

#### Evaluation
Is there a data set present?  Can you see all of the relevant columns?
